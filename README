Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

This document is/will be useful:  http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me. If you would like commit access
to a user branch, send me a mail with an ssh pubkey attached.

Before production use and/or heavy testing, grep through for any
instances of "TODO" and fix them :-)

At this point, I *think* this branch (master) has feature (and bug)
parity with the stock networking scripts in Slackware -current.

If you're interested in something more experimental (creation of
virtual interfaces, along with ability to add them to a bridge),
see the "virtual-ifs" branch instead.
