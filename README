Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

This document is/will be useful:  http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me.

Before production use and/or heavy testing, grep through for any
instances of "TODO" and fix them :-)

TODO:

There's plenty of room for refactoring and even rewriting here, such
as supporting addition of tun/tap devices for adding to bridges or
using for VPNs, supporting IPv6, etcetera. However, primary focus thus
far is to simply duplicate existing functionality and make sure it all
works as expected. Once that's confirmed, we can reassess where to go
from there.

I've got one host here (no tests run on this host though) that shows
the loopback interface in state UNKNOWN:
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
No idea how common this is, but perhaps a slight change of the loopback
checking logic is needed...

Tested successfully so far:
  * dhcp configuration of one interface
  * static configuration of one interface
  * bridge with four interfaces (eth0, tap1, tap2, tap3) with static
    IP address; I created the tap interfaces manually in rc.modules.local
    since there's currently no support for creating them in the network
    scripts
