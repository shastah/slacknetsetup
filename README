Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

This document is/will be useful:  http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me. If you would like commit access
to a user branch, send me a mail with an ssh pubkey attached.

Current status of master branch:

* Complete feature parity with stock networking scripts

* Supports create/destroy of virtual tun/tap interfaces
  and adding them to bridges

* Supports additional IP addresses added to interfaces
  in a way that's compatible with net-tools

* TODO: IPv6 support ; suggestions welcome, as I really don't know
        how I want to proceed with that. For home, I basically 
        rewrote (a very simple version of) the network scripts,
        but that obviously doesn't scale :/
