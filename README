Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

This document is/will be useful:  http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me. If you would like commit access
to a user branch, send me a mail with an ssh pubkey attached.

This branch is feature-complete with respect to the stock networking
scripts in Slackware -current, but it also (has|will hopefully have)
other features listed below as TODO items.

TODO:
  * create tun/tap interfaces			[done]
  * additional IP addresses to interfaces	[done]
  * IPv6 support				[yuck]
