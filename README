Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me.

Before production use and/or heavy testing, grep through for any
instances of "TODO" and fix them :-)
