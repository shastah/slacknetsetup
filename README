Greetings, Slackers! 

Let's look into migrating Slackware's net config to use iproute2!

This document is/will be useful:  http://baturin.org/docs/iproute2/

To prevent multiple people trying to push changes to master branch,
please make changes in a user branch, push them, and I'll merge,
or make a diff and send it to me. If you would like commit access
to a user branch, send me a mail with an ssh pubkey attached.

Current status of master branch:

* Complete feature parity with stock networking scripts
* Supports create/destroy of virtual tun/tap interfaces
  and adding them to bridges
